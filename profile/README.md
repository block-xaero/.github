## Mission

At Block-Xaero, our mission is to create trustless, scalable, and high-performance systems for the decentralized future. We focus on:
- **Digital Identity (ZeroID):** Empowering individuals with decentralized identity, free from centralized authorities.
- **Blockchain Evolution (OneChain):** Simplifying blockchain architectures to support unified ledger technologies and robust, scalable governance.
- **Decentralized Storage & Sync (XaeroFlux):** Delivering an append-only, event-based storage engine that seamlessly synchronizes data in a p2p, cloudless fashion, optimized for mobile platforms.

## Projects

### ZeroID
ZeroID is our decentralized identity solution that promotes privacy and security:
- **Zero Trust:** Rely on cryptographic proofs instead of central authorities.
- **Privacy by Design:** Enable secure, self-sovereign identity management.
- **Interoperability:** Integrate with a variety of systems, ensuring your identity travels safely across services.

### OneChain
OneChain is our approach to next-generation blockchain architectures:
- **Unified Ledger:** Consolidate multiple chains into a single, cohesive system.
- **Decentralized Governance:** Facilitate democratic, distributed decision-making.
- **Scalable & Secure:** Ensure high performance while preserving the security standards necessary for enterprise and consumer applications.

### XaeroFlux
XaeroFlux is our decentralized, append-only event storage engine designed for efficient p2p synchronization:
- **Efficient Storage:** Built on RocksDB with Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) and Merkle tree indexing.
- **Transparent p2p Sync:** All networking and synchronization happen in the background—presenting a clean, DB-like API.
- **Mobile Optimized:** Tailored for resource-constrained environments such as iOS and Android, ensuring low-latency, high-reliability performance.
